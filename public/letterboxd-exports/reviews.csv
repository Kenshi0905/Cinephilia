2025-05-16,Attack on Titan The Final Chapters: Special 2,2023,https://boxd.it/9HCyD7,5,Yes,"a satisfactory conclusion to a saga of hope and resilience, never did i think when i first watched attack on titan in 2018 that this series would end up being so high on all my lists.
this is one of those where you can see the beauty of storytelling at its peak.
the final battle, how zeke helps them, the death of eren, how eren gets confronted by armin in the end and finally his confession. these are not just mere scenes, they are works of art crafted over the years and giving us a proper closure to all the deaths we've seen of our favourites and honouring them. they are not just characters, they are a representation of humanity and attack on titan is a mirror of all the human attributes that have led us to destruction.
in the end, we understand what eren was going through, he can finally die and let everyone live on his behalf.
a story of hope, resilience and humanity ends with the power of the monsters haunting them taken away, he asks everyone to live on.

they had absolutely brilliant cinematography, i would've wanted to see the actual drivers talk more in the film but i absolutely loved the references like when alonso randomly pulls up and pats brad pitt on the back during an interview.
the plot was a little weak, even some things could be considered improbable to happen in real life formula one, but in my honest opinion this is a great movie which is a completely well executed original and does not carry itself on the back of an established great of the sport like in the documentaries.

While everyone was getting their own live action adaptations, amidst all the Marvel and DC debate was lost one of the most important characters in comic book history. The one who was too difficult to be portrayed in the traditional sense of cinema and one who hasn't had a good adaptation in a decade or two.
Superman.
Ever since his arrival on Action Comics #1, Superman has been a symbol of hope, love and humanity (also a bit of pure Americana too :P). But letting the Reeve Superman aside, none could actually match up to his humongous name. But I think James Gunn has completely nailed it.
Although in the true sense of everything, he understood what superman is and what he stood for. He is in all true sense a real visionary who could see how the character should be portrayed.
Some parts of the movie may have been a bit questionable and the story may have moved a little fast but it is overshadowed by an amazing portrayal of the Man of Steel by David Corenswet (all the characters have the perfect casting in my opinion). Gunn with all his experience from GOTG has made this movie as fun as the movies in that trilogy.
What Snyder failed to accomplish was that, even if he tried the best he focused his interest more on the ""God"" side of superman, not the ""Human"" that resides within Superman. He isn't some god who is answerable to no one, he is human, he can make mistakes, hence he is a hero and is loved by the entire world.","superman, superhero, comicmovie, action, adventure, drama",2025-07-11

it is perfectly deserving of being india's pick at the oscars, it breaks us apart with every moment, shown the pain of how difficult it is to be discriminated on the basis of caste and religion.
here is the reality, the ground reality, for those who still don't understand it maybe this movie is a reminder to let them know, and make them care.",,2025-11-23

such a big successful movie, but i have not many complaints from it, that is rare esp in hindi cinema.
the gore too wasn't overdone, it was tasteful, as much as it is required and not a tad bit more. 
i really wanted the gaalis to be uncensored welp here we are cockblocked by india's cbfc, nonetheless it was such a great movie.
tbh it was more of a ""akshaye khanna the movie ft. ranveer singh"" but i guess the worldbuilding required one movie time to establish this huge world.
solid movie fr and a fully theatrical experience.",,2025-12-19

2026-01-02,Stranger Things 5: The Finale,2025,https://boxd.it/cmGslp,3.5,,"first movie of the year, and probably one of the <b>most</b> anticipated endings to a show.

i grew up with this show, i watched s1 and was <i>way</i> <i>too scared of the demos</i> of s2, eventually i gave in and watched that too.

don't get me wrong but this ending was a tad bit empty for me. it did give <i>closure</i> to the series as needed but lacked in dialogue, deliver and script pretty bad.

it was carried hard by the stunning performances by Gaten Matarazzo and Joey Keery, alongside with David Harbour, Sadie Sink and Nell Fisher. They were the only ones who I believe gave remarkable perfomances in this extravaganza.

It was filled with dispersed tension and quite a few plot holes with the biggest one being ""If Jim Hopper is dead, how does he get to be the chief of police, didn't he fake his death to hide?"", it's either i'm too dumb to find the answer or it's just never answered.

if his backstory was shown, it would somewhat make his case <i>wayyy</i> better.
let to rest the flaws, the movie is action packed and a very engaging watch, you do not get bored at all, but in getting the engagement it lost to some parts in the script where it was just a plethora of very impactful dialogues delivered half hazardly.
this is something I'd rate 3/5 if I saw it on OTT first, but because of the huge theatrical advantage it has rn it's a 4/5.",,2026-01-02
